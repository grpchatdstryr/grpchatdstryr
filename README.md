### Hey There!

My name is Nathan Patrick, and welcome to my GitHub! This contains an assortment of various personal projects compiled over college. My best and favorite method of learning is trying new things on my own. Here you will find some of the projects I have pursued, some spanning over days, others months. I hope you can take somethings away from this, find inspiration, or just see some of the fun things that are out there!
